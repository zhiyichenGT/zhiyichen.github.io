<p>Since the pandemic started, various research teams have worked on analyzing the sentiment of COVID-19 specific tweets. For example, Chakraborty and her team found through a deep learning classifier that though most tweets regarding COVID-19 were positive, many re-tweets contained little to no useful words but disseminated useless information just as the pandemic had spread into humanity (Chakraborty et al., 2020, p. 106754). There is also research that focuses more on the machine learning perspective than the societal perspective: Sethi and his team analyzed bi-class and multi-class setting over n-gram feature set along with a cross-dataset evaluation of different machine learning techniques, achieving a maximum accuracy of about 93% in detecting the actual sentiment behind a tweet related to COVID-19 (Sethi et al., 2020, pp. 1–3).

<p>Despite all the previous work, little is done on analyzing the public's perception of the COVID-19 vaccine. For months, scientists around the world have been racing to produce an effective vaccine and governments have been throwing billions at pharmaceutical companies to be first in line for access. But despite the severe disruption caused by the pandemic, a significant minority of people say they don’t want to register the vaccine even when one becomes available. As a result, this project analyzes the tweets with the #CovidVaccine hashtag as an attempt to acquire more insights into the public's perception and the root cause of skepticism towards COVID vaccines.
