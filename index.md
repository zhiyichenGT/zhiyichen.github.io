### About Me

I am a second year Ph.D. Student in Computer Science at Georgia tech, advised by Alberto Dainotti. I am interested in intersection of machine learning and Internet. I currently work on classifying Autonomous Systems to provide a better understanding to the Internet ecosystem. Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my Bachelor degree in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University in 2020.

### Research Interests

Application of machine learning in data science

Internet measurement

Cybersecurity
