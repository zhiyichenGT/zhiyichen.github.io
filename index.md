### About Me

I am a third year Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. Alberto Dainotti. I am interested in intersection of machine learning and Internet measurement. Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my bachelor's degree in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University in 2020.

### Research Interests

Application of machine learning in data science

Internet measurement

Cybersecurity
