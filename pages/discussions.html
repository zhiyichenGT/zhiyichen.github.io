One difficulty that we think may arise is the change in attitudes and reasons of vaccine skepticism over time. The tweets data spans over a year, from before the pandemic started in the US to the vaccine roll-out began. And there have been many major events around the world aside from the coronavirus. We highly suspect that there is a temporal change in attitudes that may affect the accuracies of the model. Of course, if time permits, we will also analyze the time series temporally.</p>
<p>We expect our results to not only align with most of the previous studies in terms of the reason for the vaccine skepticism but also provide additional reasons such as geographical, political, economic attributions. The results of the project will hopefully help governments around the world to understand the public's perception better and make adjustments to their vaccine roll-out plans.
